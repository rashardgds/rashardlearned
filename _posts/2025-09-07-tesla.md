>One of the test flight objectives was to demonstrate that the new rocket could carry a payload as far as the orbit of Mars. NASA deputy administrator Lori Garver stated that SpaceX had "offered free launches to NASA, Air Force etc. but got no takers", and that "the Tesla gimmick was the backup".[18]

The Roadster is the first standard roadworthy vehicle sent into space,[19] following several special-purpose lunar and Mars rovers.

'''Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster''' is an electric sports car that served as the [[Boilerplate (spaceflight)|dummy payload]] for the February 2018 [[Falcon Heavy test flight]] and became an [[artificial satellite]] of the Sun.

Even if the rocket had targeted an actual [[Mars transfer orbit]], the car could not have been placed into orbit around Mars, because the upper stage that carries it is not equipped with the necessary propellant, maneuvering, and communications capabilities.

The choice of the Roadster as a dummy payload was variously interpreted as marketing for Tesla, or a work of art, with some worrying about the risk to contamination of otherwise sterile solar system bodies. Some also commented on how the Roadster was not a [[space debris]] risk.

''[[The Verge]]'' likened the Roadster to a "[[Found object|ready-made]]" work of art, such as [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s 1917 piece [[Fountain (Duchamp)|''Fountain'']], created by placing an everyday object in an unusual position, context and orientation.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/10/16997124/elon-musk-spacex-tesla-art-starman-advertising|title=Elon Musk made history launching a car into space.

[[Alice Gorman]], a lecturer in archaeology and space studies at [[Flinders University]] in Australia, said that the Roadster's primary purpose is symbolic communication, that "the red sports car symbolises [[masculinity]] – power, wealth and speed<ref>{{Cite web |last=David |first=Leonard |date=2018-02-09 |title=Tesla Roadster Gets Interplanetary ID |url=https://www.space.com/39646-tesla-roadster-gets-interplanetary-id.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220092347/https://www.space.com/39646-tesla-roadster-gets-interplanetary-id.html |archive-date=2018-02-20 |access-date= |website=Space.com}}</ref> – but also how fragile masculinity is".

=== Space debris non-risk ===
Orbital debris expert Darren McKnight stated that the car poses no risk because it is far from Earth orbit. He added: "The enthusiasm and interest that [Musk] generates more than offsets the infinitesimally small 'littering' of the cosmos."<ref>{{Cite web |last=David |first=Leonard |date=2018-02-05 |title=Is the Tesla Roadster Flying on the Falcon Heavy's Maiden Flight Just Space Junk? |url=https://www.space.com/39602-falcon-heavy-tesla-not-just-space-junk.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206182537/https://www.space.com/39602-falcon-heavy-tesla-not-just-space-junk.html |archive-date=2018-02-06 |access-date= |website=Space.com}}</ref> Tommy Sanford, director of the [[Commercial Spaceflight Federation]], said that the car and its rocket stage are no more "space junk" than the mundane material usually launched on other test flights.

=== Bacteriological contamination ===

[[The Planetary Society]] was concerned that launching a non-sterile object to interplanetary space may risk [[Planetary protection|biological contamination]] of a foreign world.<ref>[https://www.planetary.org/articles/20180205-space-tesla Let's talk about Elon Musk launching his Tesla into space] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190630211257/http://www.planetary.org/blogs/jason-davis/2018/20180205-space-tesla.html |date=June 30, 2019 }}. Jason Davis, ''The Planetary Society''. 5 February 2018.</ref> Scientists at [[Purdue University]] noted that the vehicle will be sterilized by solar radiation over time and the vehicle is most likely to hit the Earth in the future, though some bacteria might survive on some components of the vehicle which could contaminate Mars in the distant future if it were to hit Mars instead.<ref>{{cite web |author=Szondy |first=David |date=February 27, 2018 |title=Tesla in space could carry bacteria from Earth |url=https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2018/Q1/tesla-in-space-could-carry-bacteria-from-earth.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201020220507/https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2018/Q1/tesla-in-space-could-carry-bacteria-from-earth.html |archive-date=October 20, 2020 |access-date=October 24, 2020 |work=Purdue University}}</ref>

Through measuring changes in apparent brightness of the object, astronomers have determined that the Roadster is rotating with a period of 4.7589 ± 0.0060 minutes (i.e. 4 minutes, 46 seconds).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/satellites/a17762760/heres-exactly-how-fast-elon-musks-tesla-is-spinning-in-space/|title=Here's Exactly How Fast Elon Musk's Tesla Is Spinning In Space|date=February 13, 2018|access-date=February 13, 2018|archive-date=February 14, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180214014740/https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/satellites/a17762760/heres-exactly-how-fast-elon-musks-tesla-is-spinning-in-space/|url-status=live}}</ref> By February 11, 2018, [[astrometry]] measurements from 241 independent observations had been collated, refining the positions to within one-tenth of an [[arcsecond]] and published by the [[SeeSat-L]] mailing list, a group of amateur satellite spotters—more accurate than for most observations of objects in space.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.satobs.org/seesat/Feb-2018/0117.html|title=Re: Tesla roadster and booster observations|first=Bill|last=Gray|date=2018-02-11|via=[[SeeSat-L]] mailing list|quote=list of 241 observations and growing [...] continue to be observed for about two weeks.

=== Predictions ===
The roadster made its first close approach to Mars on October 7, 2020. The next close approach to Earth will be in the year 2047 at a distance of 5 million kilometers, about 13 times the distance between Earth and the Moon.<ref name="Kim" /> Simulations over a 3-million-year timespan found a probability of the Roadster colliding with [[Earth]] at approximately 6%, or with [[Venus]] at approximately 2.5%. These probabilities of collision are similar to those of other [[near-Earth object]]s. The [[half-life]] for the tested orbits was calculated as approximately 20 million years, but with trajectories varying significantly following a close approach to the Earth–Moon system in 2091.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rein|first1=Hanno|last2=Tamayo|first2=Daniel|last3=Vokrouhlicky|first3=David|title=The random walk of cars and their collision probabilities with planets|journal=Aerospace|volume=5|issue=2|pages=57|arxiv=1802.04718|date=13 February 2018|doi=10.3390/aerospace5020057|bibcode=2018Aeros...5...57R|s2cid=119328461|doi-access=free}}</ref>
